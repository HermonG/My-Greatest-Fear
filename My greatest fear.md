Hello 
# My graetest fear 
when the worst possible thing has happened and I heard there had been an accident.
I don't want to watch anyone close to me die or suffer; I want to die before my father, mother, sister, or brother; 
I don't want to see any of them suffer or die before I do, 
Beause I'm aware that the world isn't kind for me without them.
